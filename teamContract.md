# Team Contract

## Communication
*Team meetings*
Our team will meet every Friday from 3:00 PM - 4:00 PM on Discord. Emi will be the designated note-taker for meetings. All of the notes will have a title indicating the date and time of the meeting and will be stored in an ongoing Google Document in our shared group folder. We will all contribute to the weekly Development Log.

*Assistance*
We will collaborate over Discord. Responses will be ASAP, but if they are not received after one week, we will private message the person who didn't respond. If they still don't respond, we will escalate it.

*Respect*
We will make decisions based on a majority vote, which will allow each member to have input in decisions being made.

## Collaboration
*Work Distribution*
Every week, we will split up work into multiple tasks, and each team member will get a roughly equal number of tasks, first based on volunteering, then based on random assignment.

*Time Commitment*
Each group member will work between two and six hours per week on the project. If more time is needed, then we will reassess.

*Conflict Resolution*
Conflicts will be discussed in private between the people having conflicts. If it involves the whole group, we'll discuss them there. If this doesn't work out, we'll escalate to the course staff.
